## Best Practices

### Asking Effective Questions

**✅ DO:**
- Be specific and clear
- Use proper names when available
- Ask one question at a time
- Provide context when needed

**❌ DON'T:**
- Ask vague or overly broad questions
- Combine multiple unrelated questions
- Use excessive abbreviations without context

### Examples

**Good Questions:**
- "Who is the Dean of Lee Kong Chian Faculty of Engineering and Science?"
- "Is the journal 'Cell' in the Nature Index?"
- "List all departments in FSc"

**Needs Improvement:**
- "Tell me everything about UTAR" (too broad)
- "Who's the dean?" (which faculty?)
- "Is this journal good?" (which journal?)

### Understanding Responses

- **Live Data**: Staff and journal information is pulled from live databases
